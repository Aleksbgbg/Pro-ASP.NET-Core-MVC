# Party Invites
The app implemented in chapter 2 of the book.

This first simple app is an introduction to models, views, and controllers (the entire MVC pattern), including a dabble in Bootstrap for a nicer looking interface.

The app allows users to accept invitations to party.

Four pages are contained in total:
- Home page (/Home/Index)
- RSVP form (/Home/RsvpForm)
- Thanks page (accessed after submitting valid form)
- Response list (/Home/ListResponses)
